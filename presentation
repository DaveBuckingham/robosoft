have created backbone for human interface

from gamepad to arduino pins

(demonstrate leds)

gamepad -> laptop -> arduino -> laptop

laptop code is (almost) architecture independent

highly modular (can adapt as project develops)

e.g. button-to-behavior maping is encapsulated
so its easy to define new control schemes

(demonstrate example: direct vs toggle modes)

possible next steps:
    rich graphical display
    full architecture independence
    design several control mapings
    macros
    wireless laptop -> arduino
    wireless gamepad -> laptop
    optimize for more speed

please provide critical feedback and suggestions
